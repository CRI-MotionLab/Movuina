### views

The main html template is the `views/default.ejs` file, providing a basic
structure for a responsive website.

In order to be rendered properly, it needs some parameters defined in the
`src/server/route.js` and `src/server/menus.js` files, as well as some other
parameters from one of the config files in `src/server/config/`.
