# express-playground

### starter project for express based websites

The express-playground project is written in es6 and uses `babel` to transpile all its source code.
It also uses `browserify` to bundle all the transpiled client code, `node-sass`
to generate the css files, and the `ejs` template engine for rendering html.

The `npm run watch` and `npm run start` commands allow for serving the website
by running a basic `express` server which can be customized later on.
The `npm run render` command renders a static html website like this one.
